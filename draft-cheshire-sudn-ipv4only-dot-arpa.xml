      <t>The document
      "Discovery of the IPv6 Prefix Used for IPv6 Address Synthesis" [RFC7050]
      specifies the Special Use Domain Name 'ipv4only.arpa',
      with certain precise special properties, but, perversely, the
      Domain Name Reservation Considerations section [RFC6761]
      in that document then goes on to deny the specialness of that name,
      and (as of May 2016) the name 'ipv4only.arpa' does not appear
      in the Special-Use Domain Names registry.</t>

      <t>This document updates RFC 7050 with a more appropriate summary of
      the legitimate and useful special properties of the name 'ipv4only.arpa',
      and the corresponding reverse mapping names.</t>

      <t>The document
      <xref target="RFC7050">"Discovery of the IPv6 Prefix Used for IPv6 Address Synthesis"</xref>
      specifies the Special Use Domain Name 'ipv4only.arpa',
      with certain precise special properties, but, perversely, the
      <xref target="RFC6761">Domain Name Reservation Considerations section</xref>
      in that document denies the specialness of that name,
      and (as of May 2016) the name 'ipv4only.arpa' does not appear
      in the <xref target="SUDN">Special-Use Domain Names registry</xref>.</t>

      <t>As a result of the name 'ipv4only.arpa' being formally declared to have
      no special properties, there was no mandate for software to treat this name
      specially. Consequently, queries for this name have to be handled normally,
      and result in a large volume of unnecessary queries to the 'arpa' name servers.</t>

      <t>Having millions of devices around the world issue these queries generates
      pointless additional load on the 'arpa' name servers, which is completely
      unnecessary when the name 'ipv4only.arpa' is defined, by Internet Standard,
      to have only two IPv4 address records, 192.0.0.170 and 192.0.0.171,
      and no other records of any type.</t>

      <t>At times, for reasons that are as yet
      unclear, the 'arpa' name servers have been observed to be slow or unresponsive.
      The failures of these 'ipv4only.arpa' queries result in unnecessary failures of
      software that depends on them for NAT64 address synthesis.</t>

      <t>To remedy this situation, this document updates RFC 7050 with a more appropriate
      <xref target="RFC6761">Domain Name Reservation Considerations section</xref>
      that properly lists the desirable and beneficial special handling for 'ipv4only.arpa'.</t>

        <t>When queried via a DNS64 recursive/caching server, the name
        'ipv4only.arpa' is defined to also have two IPv6 AAAA records,

        These two considerations are listed in items 2 and 4 below:

          <list style="numbers">
            <t>Normal users should never have reason to encounter the 'ipv4only.arpa'

            result in the answers specified in RFC 7050.<vspace />
            Normal users have no need to know that 'ipv4only.arpa' is special.</t>

            <t>Application software may explicitly use the name 'ipv4only.arpa' for NAT64

            If application software encounters the name 'ipv4only.arpa' in the normal
            course of handling user input, the application software should resolve
            that name as usual and need not treat it in any special way.</t>

            <t>Name resolution APIs and libraries SHOULD NOT recognize
            'ipv4only.arpa' as special and SHOULD NOT treat it differently.

<?rfc needLines="15" ?>

            Instead, recursive/caching DNS servers SHOULD, by default, act as

            IPv4 address queries (DNS qtype "A"),
            and a "no&nbsp;error&nbsp;no&nbsp;answer" response for all other query types.

            For example, if the user were to issue the Unix command "host&nbsp;192.0.0.170"

          <t>For all IPv6 addresses synthesized by the NAT64 gateway,
          the DNS64 recursive/caching server is responsible for
          synthesizing the appropriate ip6.arpa reverse mapping PTR records,
          if it chooses to do so.
          The same applies to the synthesized IPv6 addresses corresponding
          to the IPv4 addresses 192.0.0.170 and 192.0.0.171.</t>

          <t>Generally a DNS64 recursive/caching server synthesizes
          appropriate ip6.arpa reverse mapping PTR records by extracting
          the embedded IPv4 address from the encoded IPv6 address,
          performing a reverse mapping query for that IPv4 address,
          and then synthesizing a corresponding ip6.arpa reverse mapping
          PTR record containing the same rdata.</t>

          <t>In the case of synthesized IPv6 addresses corresponding
          to the IPv4 addresses 192.0.0.170 and 192.0.0.171,
          the DNS64 recursive/caching server does not issue mapping queries
          for those IPv4 addresses, but instead, according to rule 3 above,
          immediately returns the answer 'ipv4only.arpa'.</t>
