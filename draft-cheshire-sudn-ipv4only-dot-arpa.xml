      <t>Consequently, despite the well articulated special purpose of the name,
      as of July 2016 'ipv4only.arpa' still does not appear as one of the names with special
      properties that are recorded in the <xref target="SUDN">Special-Use Domain Names registry</xref>.</t>

      <t>This document rectifies that omission, formally declaring the actual
      special properties of the name. This document also adds similar declarations
      for the corresponding reverse mapping names.</t>
    </section>

    <section title="Specialness of 'ipv4only.arpa'">
      <t>The hostname 'ipv4only.arpa' is peculiar in that it was never intended
      to be treated like a normal hostname.</t>

      <t>A typical client never looks up the IPv4 address records for 'ipv4only.arpa',
      because it is already known, <xref target="RFC7050">by specification</xref>,
      to have exactly two IPv4 address records, 192.0.0.170 and 192.0.0.171.
      No client ever has to look the name in order to learn those two addresses.</t>

      <t>In contrast, clients often look up the IPv6 AAAA address records for
      'ipv4only.arpa', which on the face of it might seem a little odd, given
      that it is already known, <xref target="RFC7050">by specification</xref>,
      that no such IPv6 AAAA address records exist. And yet, clients expect to
      receive, and do in fact receive, positive answers for these IPv6 AAAA
      address records that are known to not exist.</t>

      <t>This is clearly not a typical DNS name. Clients never normally query for
      the two records that do in fact exist, instead querying for records that
      are known to not exist, and getting positive answers to those bogus queries.
      Clients are using DNS to perform queries for this name, but they are certainly not
      using DNS to learn legitimate answers from the name's legitimate authoritative server.
      Instead, clients are using these pseudo-DNS queries as an impromptu middlebox
      communication protocol, to communicate with the
      NAT64/DNS64 <xref target="RFC6146"/><xref target="RFC6147"/> gateway,
      if present, and request that it disclose the prefix it is using for IPv6 address synthesis.</t>

      <t>It is this use of specially-crafted DNS queries for 'ipv4only.arpa' as an
      impromptu middlebox communication protocol that makes the name 'ipv4only.arpa'
      noteworthy, and legitimately qualifying to be described as a 'special' name.</t>
    </section>

    <section title="Consequences of 'ipv4only.arpa' previously being unspecial">
      <t>As a result of <xref target="RFC7050">the original specification</xref>
      not formally declaring 'ipv4only.arpa' to have special properties,
      there was no mandate for any software to treat this name
      specially. Consequently, queries for this name had to be handled normally,
      resulting in unnecessary queries to the authoritative 'arpa' name servers.</t>

      <t>Having millions of devices around the world issue these queries generated
      pointless additional load on the authoritative 'arpa' name servers, which was completely
      unnecessary when the name 'ipv4only.arpa' is defined, by Internet Standard,
      to have exactly two IPv4 address records, 192.0.0.170 and 192.0.0.171,
      and no other records of any type.</t>

      <t>Also, at times, for reasons that are as yet
      unclear, the authoritative 'arpa' name servers were observed to be slow or unresponsive.
      The failures of these 'ipv4only.arpa' queries resulted in unnecessary failures
      of software that depended on them for <xref target="RFC6147">DNS64</xref> address synthesis.</t>

      <t>Even when the authoritative 'arpa' name servers are operating correctly,
      having to perform an unnecessary query to obtain an answer that is already
      known in advance adds precious milliseconds of delay for no reason.</t>

      <t>This document updates <xref target="RFC7050">the previous specification</xref>
      with a more appropriate
      <xref target="RFC6761">Domain Name Reservation Considerations section</xref> that
      accurately lists the actual special properties of the name 'ipv4only.arpa' so that
      software can legitimately make appropriate performance and reliability optimizations.</t>

    <section title="Security Considerations">
      <t>Hard-coding the known answers for 'ipv4only.arpa' queries avoids the risk of
      malicious devices intercepting those queries and returning incorrect answers.</t>

      <t>One of the known problems with <xref target="RFC6147">DNS64</xref> is that
      it interferes with DNSSEC. DNSSEC may cryptographically assert that a name
      has no IPv6 AAAA records, while at the same time DNS64 address synthesis
      is contradicting this and claiming that IPv6 AAAA records do exist.
      This problem can be mitigated by having the client
      (i) query for the (signed) IPv4 address records itself,
      (ii) interrogate the local NAT64/DNS64 gateway with an 'ipv4only.arpa' query to learn
      the IPv6 address synthesis prefix, and then
      (iii) perform its own IPv6 address synthesis locally using the DNSSEC-signed data.
      This approach is more attractive if it doesn't create an additional
      dependency on the authoritative 'arpa' name servers to answer a
      pointless query that is unnecessary because the NAT64/DNS64 gateway
      should already know the answer before it even issues the query.</t>

            If application software encounters the name 'ipv4only.arpa' in the normal

    <section anchor="app-a" title="Example BIND 9 Configuration">
      <t>A BIND 9 recursive/caching DNS server could be configured to
      act as authoritative for the appropriate names as follows.</t>

      <t><vspace blankLines="1" />
      In /etc/named.conf the following lines are added:
      <figure><artwork>
 zone "ipv4only.arpa"            { type master; file "ipv4only"; };
 zone "170.0.0.192.in-addr.arpa" { type master; file "ipv4only-r"; };
 zone "171.0.0.192.in-addr.arpa" { type master; file "ipv4only-r"; };
      </artwork></figure></t>

      <t><vspace blankLines="1" />
      The file /var/named/ipv4only is created with the following content.
      (The lines marked "Only for DNS64 server" are omitted on a standard
      recursive/caching DNS server.)
