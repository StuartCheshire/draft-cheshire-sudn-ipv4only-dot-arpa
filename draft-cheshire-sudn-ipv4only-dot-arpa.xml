    <section title="Specialness of 'ipv4only.arpa'">
      <t>The hostname 'ipv4only.arpa' is peculiar in that it was never intended
      to be treated like a normal hostname.</t>

      <t>A typical client never looks up the IPv4 address records for 'ipv4only.arpa',
      because it is already known, <xref target="RFC7050">by specification</xref>,
      to have exactly two IPv4 address records, 192.0.0.170 and 192.0.0.171.
      No client ever has to look up the name in order to learn those two addresses.</t>

      <t>In contrast, clients often look up the IPv6 AAAA address records for
      'ipv4only.arpa', which is contrary to general DNS expectations, given
      that it is already known, <xref target="RFC7050">by specification</xref>,
      that no such IPv6 AAAA address records exist. And yet, clients expect to
      receive, and do in fact receive, positive answers for these IPv6 AAAA
      address records that are known to not exist.</t>

      <?rfc needLines="3" ?>
      <t>This is clearly not a typical DNS name. In normal operation, clients never query for
      the two records that do in fact exist; instead they query for records that
      are known to not exist, and then get positive answers to those abnormal queries.
      Clients are using DNS to perform queries for this name, but they are certainly not
      using DNS to learn legitimate answers from the name's legitimate authoritative server.
      Instead, these clients have, in effect, co-opted the DNS protocol as
      an impromptu client-to-middlebox communication protocol, to communicate with the
      NAT64/DNS64 <xref target="RFC6146"/> <xref target="RFC6147"/> gateway,
      if present, and request that it disclose the prefix it is using for IPv6 address synthesis.</t>

      <t>It is this use of specially-crafted DNS queries as an impromptu
      client-to-middlebox communication protocol that makes the name 'ipv4only.arpa'
      most definitely a special name, and one that needs to
      be listed in IANA's registry along with
      <xref target="SUDN">other DNS names that have special uses</xref>.</t>
    <?rfc needLines="14" ?>
    </section>

    <section title="Consequences of 'ipv4only.arpa' previously not being declared special">
      <t>As a result of <xref target="RFC7050">the original specification</xref>
      not formally declaring 'ipv4only.arpa' to have special properties,
      there was no clear mandate for DNS software to treat this name
      specially. Consequently, queries for this name had to be handled normally,
      resulting in unnecessary queries to the authoritative 'arpa' name servers.</t>

      <t>Having millions of devices around the world issue these queries generated
      pointless additional load on the authoritative 'arpa' name servers, which was completely
      unnecessary when the name 'ipv4only.arpa' is defined, by Internet Standard,
      to have exactly two IPv4 address records, 192.0.0.170 and 192.0.0.171,
      and no other IPv4 or IPv6 address records.</t>

      <t>Also, at times, for reasons that remain
      unclear, the authoritative 'arpa' name servers have been observed to be slow or unresponsive.
      The failures of these 'ipv4only.arpa' queries result in unnecessary failures
      of software that depends on them for <xref target="RFC6147">DNS64</xref> address synthesis.</t>

      <t>Even when the authoritative 'arpa' name servers are operating correctly,
      having to perform an unnecessary query to obtain an answer that is already
      known in advance can add precious milliseconds of delay for no reason.</t>

      <t>A more serious problem occurs when a device is configured to use a recursive resolver
      other than the one it learned from the network. Typically a device joining a NAT64
      network will learn the recursive resolver recommended for that network either
      via <xref target="RFC8106">IPv6 Router Advertisement Options for DNS Configuration</xref>
      or via <xref target="RFC3646">DNS Configuration options for DHCPv6</xref>.
      On a NAT64 network it is essential that the client use the
      DNS64 recursive resolver recommended for that network, since only that recursive resolver can
      be relied upon to know the appropriate prefix(es) to use for synthesizing IPv6
      addresses that will be acceptable to the NAT64 gateway.</t>

      <t>However, it is increasingly common for users to manually override their
      default DNS configuration because they wish to use some other public recursive
      resolver on the Internet, which may offer better speed, better reliability,
      or better privacy than the local network's default recursive resolver.
      At the time of writing, examples of widely known public recursive resolver services
      include 1.1.1.1, 8.8.8.8, and 9.9.9.9.</t>

      <t>Another common scenario is the use of corporate VPN client software, which overrides the
      local network's default configuration to divert DNS requests to the company's own private internal
      recursive resolver, because the local network's recursive resolver will typically
      be unable to provide answers for the company's private internal host names.
      Similarly, the company's private internal recursive resolver may not be able
      to synthesize IPv6 addresses correctly for use with the local network's NAT64 gateway,
      because it is unlikely to be aware of the NAT64 prefix in use on the local network.
      It is clear that a single recursive resolver cannot meet both needs.
      The local network's recursive resolver cannot give answers for some
      company's private internal host names, and some company's private internal
      recursive resolver cannot give correctly synthesized IPv6 addresses
      suitable for the local network's NAT64 gateway.</t>

      <t>The conflict here arises because DNS is being used for two unrelated purposes.
      The first purpose is retrieving data from a (nominally) global database --
      generally retrieving the IP address(es) associated with a hostname.
      The second purpose is using the DNS protocol as a middlebox communication
      protocol, to interrogate the local network infrastructure to discover
      the IPv6 prefix(es) in use by the local NAT64 gateway for address synthesis.</t>

      <t>This document leverages operational experience to update the
      <xref target="RFC6761">Domain Name Reservation Considerations</xref> section
      of <xref target="RFC7050">the earlier specification</xref>
      with one that
      accurately lists the actual special properties of the name 'ipv4only.arpa',
      so that software can legitimately implement the correct behavior necessary
      for better performance, better reliability, and correct operation.</t>
    <?rfc needLines="19" ?>
    </section>

    <section title="Security Considerations">
      <t>Hard-coding the known answers for 'ipv4only.arpa' queries in
      recursive resolvers reduces the risk of malicious devices
      intercepting those queries and returning incorrect answers, particularly in the
      case of recursive resolvers that do not perform DNSSEC validation.</t>

      <t>One of the known concerns with <xref target="RFC6147">DNS64</xref> is that
      it interferes with DNSSEC. DNSSEC may cryptographically assert that a name
      has no IPv6 AAAA records, while at the same time DNS64 address synthesis
      is contradicting this and claiming that IPv6 AAAA records do exist.</t>

      <t>Section 3 of the <xref target="RFC6147">DNS64 specification</xref>
      discusses this:
<figure><artwork>
   ... DNS64 receives a query with the DO bit set and
   the CD bit set. In this case, the DNS64 is supposed
   to pass on all the data it gets to the query initiator.
   This case will not work with DNS64, unless the
   validating resolver is prepared to do DNS64 itself.</artwork></figure></t>

      <t>The <xref target="RFC7050">NAT64 Prefix Discovery specification</xref>
      provides the mechanism for the query initiator to learn the NAT64 prefix
      so that it can do its own validation and DNS64 synthesis as described above.
      With this mechanism the client can
      (i) interrogate the local NAT64/DNS64 gateway with an 'ipv4only.arpa'
      query to learn the IPv6 address synthesis prefix,
      (ii) query for the (signed) IPv4 address records itself, and then
      (iii) perform its own IPv6 address synthesis locally,
      combining the IPv6 address synthesis prefix learned from the local NAT64/DNS64 gateway
      with the secure DNSSEC-signed data learned from the global Domain Name System.</t>

      <t>It is conceivable that over time, if DNSSEC is successful, the
      majority of clients could move to this validate-and-synthesize-locally
      model, which reduces the DNS64 machinery to the vestigial role of
      simply responding to the 'ipv4only.arpa' query to report the local
      IPv6 address synthesis prefix. In no case does the client care what
      answer(s) the authoritative 'arpa' name servers might give for that query.
      The 'ipv4only.arpa' query is being used purely as a local
      client-to-middlebox communication message.</t>

      <t>This approach is even more attractive if it does not create
      an additional dependency on the authoritative 'arpa' name
      servers to answer a query that is unnecessary
      because the NAT64/DNS64 gateway already knows the answer
      before it even issues the query. Avoiding this unnecessary
      query improves performance and reliability for the client,
      and reduces unnecessary load for the authoritative 'arpa' name servers.</t>

      <t>Note that there are two security paths to consider here:
      The path from the authoritative server to the DNS64 recursive resolver,
      and the path from the DNS64 recursive resolver to the ultimate client.
      On either or both paths there may be one or more DNS64-unaware
      recursive resolvers.</t>

      <t>The path from the authoritative server to the DNS64 recursive resolver
      (queries for IPv4 address records)
      need not be protected by DNSSEC, because the DNS64 recursive resolver
      already knows, by specification, what the answers are.
      Run-time cryptographic signatures are not needed to verify the value compile-time constants.</t>

      <t>The path from the DNS64 recursive resolver to the ultimate client
      (queries for IPv6 address records)
      *cannot* be protected by DNSSEC, because the DNS64 recursive resolver
      is synthesizing IPv6 address answers that cannot be assumed to be signed
      by the authoritative server.</t>

      <t>Consequently, the ipv4only.arpa zone MUST be an insecure delegation.</t>

        <t>When queried via a <xref target="RFC6147">DNS64</xref> recursive resolver, the name

            Normal users have no need to know that 'ipv4only.arpa' is special.</t>

            If application software encounters the name 'ipv4only.arpa' in the normal

            <t>Name resolution APIs and libraries MUST recognize

            Learning a network's NAT64 prefix is by its nature an interface-specific
            operation, and the special DNS query used to learn this interface-specific
            NAT64 prefix MUST be sent to the
            DNS recursive resolver address(es) the client learned via the configuration
            machinery for that specific client interface.
            Regardless of any manual client DNS configuration, DNS overrides
            configured by VPN client software, or any other mechanisms that influence
            the choice of the client's recursive resolver address(es)
            (including client devices that run their own local recursive resolver and use
            the loopback address as their configured recursive resolver address)
            all queries for 'ipv4only.arpa' and any subdomains of that name
            MUST be sent to the recursive resolver learned from the network interface in question

            or via <xref target="RFC3646">DNS Configuration options for DHCPv6</xref>.
            Because DNS queries for 'ipv4only.arpa' are actually a special middlebox
            communication protocol, it is essential that they go to the correct middlebox
            for the interface in question, and failure to honor this requirement would cause failure of

<?rfc needLines="5" ?>
            <t>For the purposes of this section, recursive resolvers fall into two categories.
            The first category is the traditional recursive resolvers that are in widespread use today.
            The second category is DNS64 recursive resolvers, whose purpose is to synthesize IPv6 address records.
            <vspace blankLines="1" />
            Traditional recursive resolvers SHOULD NOT recognize 'ipv4only.arpa'
            as special or give that name, or subdomains of that name, any special treatment.
            The rationale for this is that a traditional recursive resolver,
            such as built in to a home gateway, may itself be downstream of a DNS64 recursive resolver.
            Passing through the 'ipv4only.arpa' queries to the upstream DNS64 recursive resolver will allow
            the correct NAT64 prefix to be discovered.
            <vspace blankLines="1" />
            All DNS64 recursive resolvers MUST recognize 'ipv4only.arpa'
            as special and MUST NOT attempt to look up NS records for it, or otherwise
            query authoritative name servers in an attempt to resolve this name.
            Instead, DNS64 recursive resolvers MUST act as authoritative for this domain
            and generate immediate responses for all such queries.
            <vspace blankLines="1" />
            DNS64 recursive resolvers MUST generate
            the 192.0.0.170 and 192.0.0.171 responses for IPv4 address queries (DNS qtype "A"),
            the appropriate synthesized IPv6 address record responses for IPv6 address queries (DNS qtype "AAAA"),
            and a negative ("no&nbsp;error&nbsp;no&nbsp;answer") response for all other query types.
            <vspace blankLines="1" />
            For all subdomains of 'ipv4only.arpa', DNS64 recursive resolvers MUST generate immediate NXDOMAIN responses.
            All names falling below 'ipv4only.arpa' are defined to be nonexistent.

            Recursive resolvers SHOULD routinely act as
            authoritative for this name and return the results described

            explicitly configure their actual authoritative name servers to be
            authoritative for this name

            In particular, ipv4only.arpa MUST be created as an insecure delegation,
            to allow DNS64 recursive resolvers to create synthesized AAAA answers
            within that zone. Signing the ipv4only.arpa would make it impossible
            for DNS64 recursive resolvers to create synthesized AAAA answers that
            won't fail DNSSEC validation, thereby defeating the entire purpose of ipv4only.arpa.

        <t>Since the IPv4 addresses 192.0.0.170 and 192.0.0.171 are defined
        to be special, and are listed in the
        <xref target="SUv4">IPv4 Special-Purpose Address Registry</xref>,
        the corresponding reverse mapping names in the in&nbhy;addr.arpa domain
        are similarly special.</t>

        <t>The name '170.0.0.192.in&nbhy;addr.arpa' is defined, by Internet Standard,
        to have only one DNS record, type PTR, with rdata 'ipv4only.arpa'.</t>

        <t>The name '171.0.0.192.in&nbhy;addr.arpa' is defined, by Internet Standard,

        <t>There are no subdomains of '170.0.0.192.in&nbhy;addr.arpa' or '171.0.0.192.in&nbhy;addr.arpa'.
        All names falling below these names are defined to be nonexistent (NXDOMAIN).</t>

        <t>Practically speaking these two names are rarely used, but to the extent that
        they may be, they are special only to recursive resolvers as
        described in item 4 below:

          <list style="numbers">
            <t>Normal users should never have reason to encounter these two reverse mapping names.
            However, if they do, queries for these reverse mapping names should
            return the expected answer 'ipv4only.arpa'.
            Normal users have no need to know that these reverse mapping names are special.</t>

            <t>Application software SHOULD NOT recognize these two reverse mapping
            names as special, and SHOULD NOT treat them differently.<vspace />
            For example, if the user were to issue the Unix command "host&nbsp;192.0.0.170"
            then the "host" command should issue the query as usual and display the
            result that is returned.</t>

            <t>Name resolution APIs and libraries SHOULD recognize these two reverse
            mapping names as special and generate the required responses locally.
            For the names '170.0.0.192.in&nbhy;addr.arpa' and '171.0.0.192.in&nbhy;addr.arpa'
            PTR queries yield the result 'ipv4only.arpa';
            all other query types yield a negative ("no&nbsp;error&nbsp;no&nbsp;answer") response.
            For all subdomains of these two reverse mapping domains, all queries yield an NXDOMAIN response.
            All names falling below these two reverse mapping domains are defined to be nonexistent.
            <vspace blankLines="1" />
            This local self-contained generation of these responses is to avoid
            placing unnecessary load on the authoritative 'in&nbhy;addr.arpa' name servers.</t>

        <section title="ip6.arpa Reverse Mapping PTR Records">
          <t>For all IPv6 addresses synthesized by a DNS64 recursive resolver,
          the DNS64 recursive resolver is responsible for
          synthesizing the appropriate 'ip6.arpa' reverse mapping PTR records too,
          if it chooses to provide reverse mapping PTR records.
          The same applies to the synthesized IPv6 addresses corresponding
          to the IPv4 addresses 192.0.0.170 and 192.0.0.171.</t>

          <t>Generally a DNS64 recursive resolver synthesizes
          appropriate 'ip6.arpa' reverse mapping PTR records by extracting
          the embedded IPv4 address from the encoded IPv6 address,
          performing a reverse mapping PTR query for that IPv4 address,
          and then synthesizing a corresponding 'ip6.arpa' reverse mapping
          PTR record containing the same rdata.</t>

          <t>In the case of synthesized IPv6 addresses corresponding
          to the IPv4 addresses 192.0.0.170 and 192.0.0.171,
          the DNS64 recursive resolver does not issue reverse mapping queries
          for those IPv4 addresses, but instead, according to rule 3 above,
          immediately returns the answer 'ipv4only.arpa'.</t>

          <t>In the case of a client that uses the 'ipv4only.arpa' query to discover the
          IPv6 prefixes in use by the local NAT64 gateway, and then proceeds to perform
          its own address synthesis locally (which has benefits such as allowing DNSSEC validation),
          that client MUST also synthesize 'ip6.arpa' reverse mapping PTR
          records for those discovered prefix(es), according to the rules above:
          When a client's name resolution APIs and libraries receive a request
          to look up an 'ip6.arpa' reverse mapping PTR record for an address that
          falls within one of the discovered NAT64 address synthesis prefixes,
          the software extracts the embedded IPv4 address and then,
          for IPv4 addresses 192.0.0.170 and 192.0.0.171, returns the fixed answer 'ipv4only.arpa',
          and for all other IPv4 addresses performs a reverse mapping PTR query for
          the IPv4 address, and then synthesizes a corresponding 'ip6.arpa'
          reverse mapping PTR record containing the same rdata.</t>
