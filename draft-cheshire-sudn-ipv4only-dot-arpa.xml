      <t>The document
      "Discovery of the IPv6 Prefix Used for IPv6 Address Synthesis" [RFC7050]
      specifies the Special Use Domain Name 'ipv4only.arpa',
      with certain precise special properties, but, perversely, the
      Domain Name Reservation Considerations section [RFC6761]
      in that document then goes on to deny the specialness of that name,
      and (as of May 2016) the name 'ipv4only.arpa' does not appear
      in the Special-Use Domain Names registry.</t>

      <t>This document updates RFC 7050 with a more appropriate summary of
      the legitimate and useful special properties of the name ipv4only.arpa.</t>

    <section title="Introduction">
      <t>The document
      <xref target="RFC7050">"Discovery of the IPv6 Prefix Used for IPv6 Address Synthesis"</xref>
      specifies the Special Use Domain Name 'ipv4only.arpa',
      with certain precise special properties, but, perversely, the
      <xref target="RFC6761">Domain Name Reservation Considerations section</xref>
      in that document denies the specialness of that name,
      and (as of May 2016) the name 'ipv4only.arpa' does not appear
      in the <xref target="SUDN">Special-Use Domain Names registry</xref>.</t>

      <t>As a result of the name 'ipv4only.arpa' being formally declared to have
      no special properties, there was no mandate for software to treat this name
      specially. Consequently, queries for this name have to be handled normally,
      and result in a large volume of unnecessary queries to the 'arpa' name servers.</t>

      <t>At times, for reasons that are as yet
      unclear, the 'arpa' name servers have been observed to be slow or unresponsive.
      The failures of these 'ipv4only.arpa' queries result in failures of
      software that depends on them for NAT64 address synthesis.</t>

      <t>Having millions of devices around the world issue these queries generates
      pointless additional load on the 'arpa' name servers, which is completely
      unnecessary when this name is defined, by Internet Standard, to have only
      two address records, 192.0.0.170 and 192.0.0.171, and no other records.</t>

      <t>To remedy this situation, this document updates RFC 7050 with a more appropriate
      <xref target="RFC6761">Domain Name Reservation Considerations section</xref>
      that properly lists the desirable and beneficial special handling for ipv4only.arpa.</t>

    <section title="Security Considerations">
      <t>Hard-coding the answers for ipv4only.arpa queries avoids the risk of
      malicious devices intercepting those queries and returning incorrect answers.</t>
      
      <t>DNSSEC signing issues for the ipv4only.arpa address records don't apply, since
      the only use of the ipv4only.arpa name is to trigger synthesis of NAT64 AAAA
      records, which aren't signed by arpa anyway.</t>
    </section>

    <section title="IANA Considerations">
      <t>[Once published, this should say]<vspace />
      IANA has recorded the name 'ipv4only.arpa' in the
      <xref target="SUDN">Special-Use Domain Names registry</xref>.</t>

      <section title="Domain Name Reservation Considerations">
        <t>The name 'ipv4only.arpa' is special only to<vspace />
        (a) client software wishing to perform NAT64 address synthesis, and<vspace />
        (b) the DNS64 server responding to such requests.<vspace />
        These two considerations are listed in items 2 and 4 below:

          <list style="numbers">
            <t>Normal users should never have reason to encounter the ipv4only.arpa
            domain name. If they do, queries for ipv4only.arpa should
            result in the answers specified in RFC 7050.<vspace />
            Normal users have no need to know that ipv4only.arpa is special.</t>

            <t>Application software may explicitly use the name ipv4only.arpa for NAT64
            address synthesis, and expect to get the answers specified in RFC 7050.
            If application software encounters the name ipv4only.arpa in the normal
            course of handling user input, the application software should resolve
            that name as usual and need not treat it in any special way.</t>

            <t>Name resolution APIs and libraries SHOULD NOT recognize
            ipv4only.arpa as special and SHOULD NOT treat it differently.
            Name resolution APIs SHOULD send queries for this name to
            their configured recursive/caching DNS server(s).</t>

<?rfc needLines="15" ?>
            <t>Recursive/caching DNS servers SHOULD recognize ipv4only.arpa as special
            and SHOULD NOT, by default, attempt to look up NS records for it, or
            otherwise query authoritative DNS servers in an attempt to resolve this name.
            Instead, recursive/caching DNS servers SHOULD, by default, act as
            authoritative and generate immediate responses for all such queries.
            <vspace blankLines="1" />
            Traditional recursive/caching DNS servers that act as authoritative for this
            name MUST generate only the 192.0.0.170 and 192.0.0.171 responses for these
            queries, and no others.
            <vspace blankLines="1" />
            All DNS64 recursive/caching DNS servers MUST generate the
            192.0.0.170 and 192.0.0.171 address record responses for these queries,
            and MUST generate the appropriate synthesized IPv6 address record responses for all AAAA queries.
            <vspace />
            This local self-contained generation of these responses is
            to avoid placing unnecessary load on the 'arpa' name servers.</t>

            <t>Traditional authoritative DNS server software need not recognize
            ipv4only.arpa as special or handle it in any special way.<vspace />
            As a practical matter, only the administrators of the 'arpa' namespace
            will configure their name servers to be authoritative for this name
            and to generate the appropriate answers; all other authoritative
            name servers will not be configured to know anything about this name
            and will reject queries for it as they would reject queries for any
            other name about which they have no information.</t>

            <t>Generally speaking, operators of authoritative DNS servers need
            not know anything about the name ipv4only.arpa, just as they don't need
            to know anything about any other names they are not responsible for.
            Operators of authoritative DNS servers who are configuring their name servers
            to be authoritative for this name MUST understand that ipv4only.arpa is
            a special name, with answers specified by Internet Standard
            (generally this applies only to the administrators of the 'arpa' namespace).</t>

            <t>DNS Registries/Registrars need not know anything about the
            name ipv4only.arpa, just as they don't need to know
            anything about any other name they are not responsible for.
            Only the administrators of the 'arpa' namespace need to be aware
            of this name's purpose and how it should be configured.</t>
